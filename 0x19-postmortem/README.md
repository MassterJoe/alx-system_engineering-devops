By Salawu O. Joseph

Issue Summary: 

On May 6th, 2023, between 1:00 PM and 2:30 PM West African Time,
There was power outage in my area.
The outage affected me so I could not do my ALX S.E projects and tasks.

Timeline: 
1:00 PM - The issue was first started so I could not do my tasks
1:30 PM – I had to call my friends if there was light in their area
1:45 PM – A friend suggested we buy gas to power his generator so that I could charge my gadgets
2:00 PM – I got to the filling station
2:30 PM – I switched on the generator
 
Root cause and resolution:
 The root cause of the outage was a bad transformer in my street.
 The transformer has exceeded its useful life.
 Instability of electricity is a common problem here in Africa.

Corrective and preventative measures: 
To prevent similar outages in the future, the following corrective and preventative measures will be implemented:
    • The use of solar electricity
    • Buying of power bank for laptops and phones
    • I will make sure my generator is always fueled to be used in case of future outage.

Sincerely,
Salawu O. Joseph
